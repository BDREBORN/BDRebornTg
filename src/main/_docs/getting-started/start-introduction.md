Codenvy makes Cloud workspaces for development teams featuring one-click Docker environments, team onboarding and a workspace platform for DevOps. Codenvy SaaS is available for self-service at codenvy.io. You can also install Codenvy on your own infrastructure with Codenvy On-Prem.

Most of these docs refer equally to the hosted system at codenvy.io and a Codenvy on-premises installation. To avoid confusion each page inclues an "Applies to:" section at the top.

Codenvy is a commercial offering based on the Eclipse Che open source project, so Eclipse Che workspaces and plug-ins will work within Codenvy. 

Codenvy has added enterprise features to Eclipse Che including:

- User authentication, single-sign on, and LDAP
- Workspace distribution across multiple containers with an embedded Docker Swarm for scaling
- Team management, permissions and resource policy management tools
- Operational solutions for monitoring, scaling, upgrading and archiving workspaces
- Self-service user registration
- Workspace automation and JIRA, Jenkins and other integrations

You will periodically see references to Eclipse Che in these docs.
