# Organizations in Codenvy
Organization allow to regroup developers on Codenvy and allocate resources. Resources and permissions are controlled and allocated within Codenvy admin dashboard by system administrator.

## Roles
There are two main different roles in an organization:  

- **Admin**: Organization's admins are able to manage the organization. Admins can edit settings, manage members, resources and sub-organization.  
- **Members**: Organization's members are able create workspace, manage own workspaces and use any other workspaces they have permissions for.  

Alternatively there is **System Admin** role, on Codenvy System, who is able to create root organizations, manage all the resources, members and sub-organizations.

## Organization Workspaces
Workspaces created in an organization use organization resources granted and allocated by the system administrator.

## Organization Workspace Resources
Resources for organization are taken from the parent one. Admins can control whether all, or a portion of the resources, that are shared with the sub-organization.  

## Organization Structure
Organizations can have sub-organizations.
Root organizations are the starting point of each group of developers. Multiple root organizations are allowed onto your system. Root organizations can be created only be the System Admin. The management of the root organization's resources is also allowed only to the System Admin of your Codenvy installation.
