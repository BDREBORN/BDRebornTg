## Sharing Workspaces

A user with `setPermissions` privileges (See: [Permissions](../../docs/teams-and-collaboration)) can share a workspace, i.e. grant other users `read, use, run, configure or setPermissions` privileges.

Select a workspace in User Dashboard, navigate to `Share` tab and enter emails of users to share this workspace with (use comma or space as separator if there are multiple emails).
