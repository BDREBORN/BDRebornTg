## Codenvy.io Account
We run a free, hosted cloud at http://codenvy.io. This service lets you create accounts, invite other users, and create workspaces for development. The service gives you 3 GB of RAM and you can add more users or additional users for a small fee. Our terms of service and privacy policy are on [our legal page](http://codenvy.com/legal).

Your workspaces can clone Git or Subversion repositories into the project space. To prevent bad people from doing bad stuff, we whitelist all external Git providers individually. While it would be uncommon for your Git provider to not be listed in our whitelists, new providers do sometimes miss our coverage. If you are working with a non-standard provider, please consider asking us about whitelisting it by opening an issue on our [GitHub repository](http://github.com).
