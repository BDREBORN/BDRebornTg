The Codenvy LDAP integration has two major roles: synchronization and authentication.

Codenvy is compatible with `InetOrgPerson.schema`. For other schemas please contact us at info@codenvy.com. We support user authentication, LDAP connections, SSL, SASL, and various synchronization strategies.

For a user to successfully login, they must first be synchronized with Codenvy. After syncing authorization is possible:

Synchronization
* Synchronizer gets all users based on the configured groups/filters.
* Synchronizer creates a Codenvy User and persists the necessary fields from LDAP into the Codenvy database (passwords are not persisted).
* Each time the synchronizer runs the groups/filters are re-evaluated: Users that no longer match the group/filters are removed; Users that match are updated or added as needed.

Authentication
* When a user enters their name and password, the system authenticates them against the remote LDAP.
* If authentication is successful the user gains access to Codenvy.

# LDAP Authentication
User authentication is implemented as follows:

1. Search for for user DN according to the provided name. It can be performed in two ways: either by
   a given DN format, or based on a user search query.
2. To verify the user's password two functions can be used: `ldap bind` or `ldap compare`.
3. If username and password match, the LDAP entry is taken and transformed to obtain UserID (this is where synchronization configuration mechanism is applied).
4. Checks if the user with a given ID already exists in the Codenvy database. If it doesn't user is authenticated.

| Authentication Type | DN Resolution | Password Check | Entry Resolver | Mandatory Properties |
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- 
| AD | Format | Bind | User filter search | `ldap.auth.dn_format`
| AUTHENTICATED | Search | Bind or Compare if `ldap.auth.user_password_attribute` is set | User filter search | `ldap.auth.user.filter`
| ANONYMOUS | Search | Bind or Compare if `ldap.auth.user_password_attribute` is set | User filter search | `ldap.auth.user.filter`
| DIRECT | Format | Bind | DN format search | `ldap.auth.dn_format`
| SASL | Search | Bind | User filter search | `ldap.auth.user.filter`

# Configuration
There are several types of configuration covered in the tables below:
- Authentication configuration
- Connection configuration
- SSL configuration
- SASL configuration

## Authentication Configuration

| Configuration Item   | Description   
| --- | ---
| ldap.auth.authentication_type | Type of authentication to use:  <br/><br/>AD - Active Directory. Users authenticate with `sAMAccountName`. Requires the `ldap.auth.dn_format` property to be correctly configured. <br/><br/> AUTHENTICATED - Authenticated Search.  Manager bind/search followed by user simple bind. Properties:<br/>- `ldap.base_dn`<br/>- `ldap.auth.subtree_search`<br/>- `dap.auth.allow_multiple_dns`<br/>- `ldap.auth.user.filter`<br/>- `ldap.auth.user_password_attribute`<br/><br/> ANONYMOUS -  Anonymous search followed by user simple bind. Properties:<br/>- `ldap.base_dn`<br/>- `ldap.auth.subtree_search`<br/>- `dap.auth.allow_multiple_dns`<br/>- `ldap.auth.user.filter`<br/>- `ldap.auth.user_password_attribute` <br/><br/> DIRECT -  Direct Bind. Compute user DN from format string and perform simple bind. Requires `ldap.base_dn` property to be correctly configured.<br/><br/>SASL - SASL bind search. Properties: <br/>- `ldap.base_dn`<br/>- `ldap.auth.subtree_search`<br/>- `ldap.auth.allow_multiple_dns`<br/>- `ldap.auth.user.filter`   
| ldap.auth.dn_format | Resolves an entry DN by using String#format. This resolver is typically used when an entry DN can be formatted directly from the user identifier. For instance, entry DNs of the form  uid=dfisher,ou=people,dc=ldaptive,dc=org could be formatted from uid=%s,ou=people,dc=ldaptive,dc=org. <br/><br/>Example:  <br/>-`CN=%1$s,CN=Users,DC=ad,DC=codenvy-dev,DC=com`<br/><br/>Parameters:<br/>- First parameter - user name provided for password validation.   
| ldap.auth.subtree_search   | Indicates whether subtree search will be used (boolean). When set to true, allows to search authenticating DN out of the `base_dn` tree.   
| ldap.auth.allow_multiple_dns   | Indicates whether DN resolution should fail if multiple DNs are found (boolean). When false, exception will be thrown if multiple DNs is found during search. When true, the first entry will be used for authentication attempt.   
| ldap.auth.user.filter   |  Defines the [LDAP search filter](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19693-01/819-0997/gdxpo/index.html) parameters applied during search for the user (string).<br><br>It must contain an `{user}` variable and, unlike similar property from synchronization, cannot contain wildcard ('*') values (because it is supposed to search for single entity).<br><br>Examples:<br> - OpenLDAP: `cn={user}`<br> - ActiveDirectory: `(&(objectCategory=Person)(sAMAccountName={user}))`<br><br>Variables:<br>- user - user name provided for password validation.   
| ldap.auth.user_password_attribute   | Defines the LDAP attribute name, which value will be interpreted as the password during authentication (string).   

### Connection Configuration

| Configuration Item   | Description   
| --- | ---
| ldap.url | URL of the directory server (URL).<br/><br/>Example: `ldap://codenvy.com:389`   |    
| ldap.connection.connect_timeout_ms   | Time to wait for a connection to be established (milliseconds).<br/><br/>Example: `30000`   
| ldap.connection.response_timeout_ms  | Restricts all the connection to wait for a response not more than specified value (milliseconds).<br/><br/>Example: `60000`  
| ldap.connection.pool.min_size  | Size of minimum available connections in the pool (integer).<br/><br/>Example: `3`   
| ldap.connection.pool.max_size  | Size of maximum available connections in<br/>the pool (integer).<br/><br/>Example: `10`
| ldap.connection.pool.validate.on_checkout   | Indicates whether connections will be validated before being picked from the pool (boolean). Connections that fail validation are evicted from the pool.   
| ldap.connection.pool.validate.on_checkin   | Indicates whether connections will be validated before being returned to the pool (boolean). Connections that fail validation are evicted from the pool.   
| ldap.connection.pool.validate.periodically   | Indicates whether connections should be validated periodically when the pool is idle (boolean). Connections that fail validation are evicted from the pool.   
| ldap.connection.pool.validate.period_ms   | Period at which pool should be validated (milliseconds). Default value is 30 min.   
| ldap.connection.pool.idle_ms   | Time at which a connection should be considered idle and become a candidate for removal from the pool (milliseconds).   
| ldap.connection.pool.prune_ms   | Period between connection pool prunes - when idle connections are removed (milliseconds).   
| ldap.connection.pool.fail_fast   | Indicates whether an exception should be thrown during pool initialization when the pool does not contain at least one connection and it's minimum size is greater than zero (boolean).
| ldap.connection.pool.block_wait_ms   | Time during which a pool which has reached maximum size will block new requests - during this time a `BlockingTimeoutException` will be thrown (milliseconds). Default time is `infinite`.
| ldap.connection.bind.dn  | Since connections are initialized by performing a bind operation, this property indicates the DN to make this bind with (string).<br><br>Example: `userX`<br><br>On Active Directory, a special mode called [FastBind](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc223503) can be activated by setting both `ldap.connection.bind.dn` and `ldap.connection.bind.password` to a value of "*". In this mode, no group evaluation is done, so it can be used only to verify a client's credentials.
| ldap.connection.bind.password | Credential for the initial connection bind (string).<br><br>Example: `password`<br><br>On Active Directory, a special mode called [FastBind](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc223503) can be activated by setting both `ldap.connection.bind.dn` and `ldap.connection.bind.password` to a value of "*". In this mode, no group evaluation is done, so it can be used only to verify a client's credentials.


### SSL Configuration
SSL can be configured in two ways - using trust certificate or using secure keystore.

Certificates from a trusted certificate authority (CA) do not need any additional actions like manual import. It's enough to just turn SSL on.

Self-signed certificates must be imported into the Java keystore or used separately. See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/security/toolsign/rstep2.html for keystore import instructions.

| Configuration Item   | Description   
| --- | ---
| ldap.connection.use_ssl   | Indicates whether the secured protocol will be used for connections (boolean).   
| ldap.connection.use_start_tls   | Indicates whether TLS (Transport Layer Security) should be established on connections (boolean).   
| ldap.connection.ssl.trust_certificates   | Path to the certificates file (string). <br><br>Example: `file:///etc/ssl/mycertificate.cer`   
| ldap.connection.ssl.keystore.name   | Defines name of the keystore to use (string). <br><br>Example: `file:///usr/local/jdk/jre/lib/security/mycerts`   
| ldap.connection.ssl.keystore.password   | Defines keystore password (string).   
| ldap.connection.ssl.keystore.type   | Defines keystore type (string).   

### SASL Configuration
The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) is a method for adding authentication support to connection-based protocols. To use this specification, a protocol includes a command for identifying and authenticating a user to a server and for optionally negotiating a security layer for subsequent protocol interactions.

As an example, if the client and server both uses TLS, and have trusted certificates, they may use  SASL / EXTERNAL, and for client requests the server can derive its identity from credentials provided at a lower (TLS) level.

| Configuration Item   | Description   
| --- | ---
| ldap.connection.sasl.mechanism   | Defines SASL mechanism. Supported values are `DIGEST_MD5`, `CRAM_MD5`, `GSSAPI` and `EXTERNAL`.<br/><br/>See [AD explanation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc223371.aspx)<br/>See [OpenLDAP explanation](http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin24/sasl.html)   
| ldap.connection.sasl.realm   | SASL realm value (string). <br/><br/>Example: `example.com`   
| ldap.connection.sasl.authorization_id   | Defines the SASL authorization ID.   
| ldap.connection.sasl.security_strength   | Specifies the client's preferred privacy protection strength (ciphers and key lengths used for encryption). <br/><br/>The value of this property is a comma-separated list of strength values, the order of which specifies the preference order. The three possible strength values are "low" "medium" and "high". Defaults is `high,medium,low`.   
| ldap.connection.sasl.mutual_auth   | SASL mutual authentication on supported mechanisms (boolean). For some applications, it is equally important that the LDAP server's identity be verified. The process by which both parties participating in the exchange authenticate each other is referred to as mutual authentication. Defaults to `false`.   
| ldap.connection.sasl.quality_of_protection   | Defines integrity and privacy protection of the communication channel. It is negotiated during the authentication phase of the SASL exchange.<br/><br/>Possible values are `auth` (default),`auth-inf` and `auth-conf`.   

### LDAP Synchronizer
This service synchronizes third party LDAP users with the Codenvy database.

### Terminology
- LDAP storage - third party directory server considered as primary users storage.
- LDAP cache - a storage in Codenvy database, which basically is a mirror of LDAP storage.
- Synchronized user - a user who is present in LDAP cache.
- Synchronization candidate - a user present in LDAP storage matching all the filters and groups, the user who is going to be synchronized.
- Codenvy User - entity in Codenvy API. A user is stored in Codenvy database (PosgreSQL).

### Synchronization Strategy
The data in the LDAP cache is considered to be consistent as long as the synchronizer does its job. Synchronization itself is unidirectional, requiring only a READ restricted connection to LDAP server.

- If the synchronizer can't retrieve users from LDAP storage, it fails.
- If the synchronizer can't store/update a user in LDAP cache it prints a warning with a reason and continues synchronization.
- If synchronization candidate is missing from LDAP cache, an appropriate User and Profile will be created.
- If synchronization candidate is present in LDAP cache, the User and Profile will be refreshed with data from LDAP storage(replacing the entity in the LDAP cache).
- If LDAP cache contains synchronized users who are missing from LDAP storage those users will be removed by the next synchronization iteration.

There are 2 possible strategies for synchronization:
1. Synchronization period is configured and synchronization is periodical.
2. Synchronization period is set to `-1` then synchronization is executed once
per server start after the configured initial delay.

Synchronization can also be triggered by a REST API call:

`POST <host>/api/sync/ldap`

This won't change the execution of a periodical synchronization, but it is guaranteed that 2 parallel synchronizations won't be executed.

### Configuration

| Configuration Item   | Description   
| --- | ---
| ldap.sync.period_ms (optional)   | How often to synchronize users and profiles (milliseconds).<br/><br/>The period property must be specified in milliseconds e.g. `86400000` is daily.<br/><br/>If the synchronization should be done only when the server starts set property to `-1`.   
| ldap.sync.initial_delay_ms   | When to synchronize the first time (milliseconds). The delay<br/>property must be specified in milliseconds.<br/><br/>Unlike period, delay must be a non-negative<br/>integer value, if it is set to `0` then synchronization will be performed immediately<br/>on sever startup.   

### Users Selection Configuration

| Configuration Item   | Description   
| --- | ---
| ldap.base_dn   | The root distinguished name to search LDAP entries, serves as a base point for searching users (string).<br/><br/>Example: `dc=codenvy,dc=com`   
| ldap.sync.user.additional_dn (optional)   | If set will be used in addition to `ldap.base_dn` for searching users (string).<br/><br/>Example: `ou=CodenvyUsers`   
| ldap.sync.user.filter   | The filter used to search users, only those users<br/>who match the filter will be synchronized (string).<br/><br/>Example: `(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)`   
| ldap.sync.page.size (optional)   | Number of LDAP entries per-page,<br/>if set to <= 0 then `1000` is used by default (integer).   
| ldap.sync.page.read_timeout_ms (optional)   | Time to wait for a page (milliseconds)<br/><br/>Default: `30000`   

### Group Configuration

| Configuration Item   | Description   
| --- | ---
| ldap.sync.group.additional_dn (optional)   | If set will be used in addition to `ldap.base_dn` for searching groups (string).<br/><br/>Example: `ou=groups`   
| ldap.sync.group.filter (optional)   | Filter used to search groups (string). The synchronizer will use this filter to find all the groups and then<br/>`ldap.sync.group.attr.members` attribute for retrieving DNs of those users who should be synchronized, please note that if this parameter is set then `ldap.sync.group.attr.members` must be also set.<br/><br/>All the users who are members of found groups will be filtered by `ldap.sync.user.filter`.<br/><br/>Example: <br/>`(&(objectClass=groupOfNames)(cn=CodenvyMembers))`   
| ldap.sync.group.attr.members (optional)   | The name of the attribute which identifies group members distinguished names (string). The  synchronizer considers this a multi-value attribute and values are user DNs.<br/><br/>This attribute is ignored if `ldap.sync.group.filter` is not set.<br/><br/>Example: `member`   

### Synchronized Data Configuration

| Configuration Item   | Description   
| --- | ---
| ldap.sync.user.attr.id   |  LDAP attribute name which defines unique mandatory user identifier, the value of this attribute will be used as Codenvy User/Profile identifier (string). <br><br> All the characters which are not in `a-zA-Z0-9-_` will be removed from user identifier during synchronization, for instance if the ID of the user is `{0-1-2-3-4-5}` he will be synchronized as a user with ID `0-1-2-3-4-5`.<br><br>Common values for this property: `cn, uid, objectGUID`.  
| ldap.sync.user.attr.name   | LDAP attribute name which defines unique user name, this attribute will be used as Condevy User name (string).<br/><br/>Common values for this property: `cn`.    
| ldap.sync.profile.attrs (optional)   | Comma-separated application-to-LDAP<br/>attribute mapping pairs. Available application attributes:<br/>- firstName<br/>- phone<br/>- lastName<br/>- employer<br/>- country<br/>- jobtitle<br/><br/>Common values for the attributes above in the described format:<br/><code>firstName=givenName,phone=telephoneNumber,<br/>lastName=sn,employer=o,country=st,jobtitle=title</code>.
| ldap.sync.user.attr.email   | LDAP attribute name which defines unique user email,<br/> the value of this attribute will be used as Codenvy<br/> User email. If there is no such analogue you can simply<br/> use the same attribute used for name (string).<br/><br/>Common values for this property: `mail`.   
| ldap.sync.page.size (optional)  | Number of LDAP entries per-page,<br/>if set to <= 0 then `1000` is used by default (integer).   
| ldap.sync.page.read_timeout_ms (optional)  | Time to wait for a page (milliseconds) <br/>Default: `30000`
