You can purchase subscriptions for codenvy.io accounts from the user dashboard. Subscriptions allow you to have:
- RAM: up to 30GB of RAM to run workspaces
- Workspace timeout: 4 hours
- Workspaces: Unlimited

Subscriptions are charged when purchased and on the first of each following month (see [billing]({{base}}{{site.links["user-subscriptions"]}}#billing)).

# Billing

Paid subscriptions are charged at the time of purchase and renewals are charged at the beginning of each month. To calculate the charge when purchased we use the daily rate for the package the user has chosen and multiply that by the number of days remaining in the month (including the day of purchase).

Example:
- **Initial purchase**: May 26th I buy a 1GB RAM package
  - May 26, my credit card is charged $1.92 (6 x $0.32)
  - June 1 and on the first of each month after, my credit card is charged $10
- **Upgrade**: June 17 I buy another 1GB RAM package
  - June 17, my credit card is charged $4.48 (14 x $0.32)
  - July 1 and on the first of each month after, my credit card is charged $20

If the credit card is removed or if the credit card cannot be charged all running workspaces will be stopped and the account resources will be moved back to the free tier level.  If the credit card can't be charged an email notification will be sent to the user warning them of the issue.

## Receipts

The following receipts are sent to paid subscription users:
- **Transaction Receipt**: Sent as soon as the credit card is charged for a subscription.
- **Monthly Subscription Summary**: Sent at the beginning of the month to any user with a credit card on file (even if it the user doesn't currently have a paid subscription). Users without a paid subscription will not be charged.
